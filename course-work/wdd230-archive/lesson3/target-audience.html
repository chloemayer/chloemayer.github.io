        <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Not only will the website target the members of the city, but also potential visitors. As a replacement for the district's outdated and buggy website, the entire community eagerly anticipates the rollout of the new site. The area is considered to be rural, but the surge of tourist activity in the last ten years has greatly urbanized the area.<br><br>
            Sun Dance's population is under 25,000, and mostly consists of families. There are larger cities in the area. A majority of the community was born and raised in the area but they are eager to welcome visitors. They would like to revitalize the city and increase tourism. On the website, they expect the city to be shown in a very positive light and want it to contain information for potential visitors. The community also looks forward to an accurate weather report page. Tourists often mention their hesitation to visit the city due to the lack of weather info and issues with the website.<br><br> 
            Although the local community will be accessing the site from desktops, SunDanceFlats.com will also need to be mobile friendly for visitors. Tourists prefer to access the site from a mobile device during their travels.<br><br>
            The site designers must also keep in mind that the site will often be visited by a very diverse array of users. Not only Americans of all ages, incomes, and ethnicities, but also countless travelers from all over the world.
