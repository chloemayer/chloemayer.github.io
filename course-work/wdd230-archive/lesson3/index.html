        <h2>SITE PLAN</h2>
        <h3>Site Name</h3>
        <p>
            The name of the website will be Sun Dance Salt Flats. The town is best known for the vast salt flats nearby, which are commonly referred to as the Sun Dance Flats. It is also a popular camping area. 
        </p>
        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The SunDanceFlats.com website will provide an aesthetically pleasing, professional, and efficiently functioning website that properly highlights the spirit of the town. Known for its picturesque salt flats and wildlife, the amount of tourist activity has significantly risen in recent years. The area now needs a more modern and reliable website, not only for the community but also for potential visitors researching the city.<br><br>
            A majority of the website's main content will consist of area news, updates, and weather reports. There will also be an Area History page as well as a Tourism Info page added at a later date. This first stage of the site construction should set the stage for the future rollout of those other pages.
        </p>
        <h3>Domain Name</h3> <!--prestonupdate.com-->
        <p>My domain name is http://www.SunDanceFlats.com. The town is often mixed up with Sun Dance Valley (also located in Utah). As a way to distinguish the town from the popular resort area, tourists often include the salt flats in their web searches. For SEO reasons, the site designers therefore decided to shorten the domain name to SunDanceFlats.com. </p>
        <h3>Website Logo</h3>
            <div class="homepgLogo">
                <img src="images/bl-adlogo.png" alt="sun dance logo">
                <p>The historic area is known for this sun symbol and it is a very common icon throughout the area. The simple image is featured on all of the tourist merchandise.</p>
