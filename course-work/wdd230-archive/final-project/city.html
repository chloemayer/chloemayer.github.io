            <p> Salt Lake City is the capital city of the state of Utah. The city was settled by members of the 
                Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in July of 1847, however, the Native American Tribes 
                had long been present. Some of the nearby tribes included the Shoshone, Paiute, and Goshute
                people. Salt Lake City was nicknamed "the crossroads of the West" and it is known as the banking 
                center of the United States of America. The 2002 Olympics were held in the state, and the surrounding area 
                is famous for its diverse outdoor activities, the most popular being skiing. Salt Lake City also 
                resides nearby most of the state's National Parks, such as Zion National Park and Arches National Park.
                The area is known for its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, and salt flats are scattered around the state.<br>
                According to the US Census Bureau in 2019, Salt Lake City's population consists of 72.8% white people, 21.8% 
                Hispanic or Latino people, and 2.6% black or African American people. Salt Lake City has a wide range of weather 
                conditions throughout the year, and the Great Salt Lake contributes to humidity. It snows a lot in the winter,
                making the nearby ski resorts very popular and well-known attractions.</p>
